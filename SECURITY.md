# Security Policy

## Overview

The EMR-Integrated Task Management Platform implements a comprehensive security architecture designed to protect sensitive healthcare data and ensure compliance with international healthcare privacy standards. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and compliance measures.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Implementation
- Edge Security Layer
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF) with healthcare-specific rulesets
  - DDoS protection with automatic mitigation
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement with certificate pinning
  - Rate limiting: 1000 requests per minute per user

- Application Security Layer
  - OAuth 2.0 + JWT authentication
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all clinical staff
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Real-time security monitoring and alerting

- Data Security Layer
  - AES-256-GCM field-level encryption for PHI/PII
  - Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
  - 90-day encryption key rotation
  - Client-side encryption for sensitive data

## Vulnerability Reporting

   - High severity: Up to $5,000
   - Medium severity: Up to $2,000
   - Low severity: Up to $500

### Reporting Process

1. Submit vulnerability details to security@emrtask.com
2. Include proof-of-concept and impact assessment
3. Allow up to 24 hours for initial response
4. Maintain confidentiality until patch release
5. Public disclosure coordinated after patch verification

## Compliance Framework

### HIPAA Compliance
- End-to-end encryption of Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Comprehensive audit logging of all PHI access
- Role-based access controls with principle of least privilege
- 7-year data retention policy implementation
- Regular security training for all staff

### GDPR Compliance
- Data minimization principles in system design
- Right to erasure implementation
- Privacy by design controls
- Cross-border data transfer controls
- Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)

### LGPD Compliance
- Explicit consent management system
- Detailed data processing documentation
- Cross-border data controls
- Privacy impact assessments
- Data subject rights management

## Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
- ELK Stack for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Prometheus for security metrics collection
- Grafana for security visualization
- PagerDuty integration for alert management

### Alert Thresholds
- Failed login attempts: >10 per minute
- API errors: >100 per minute
- Unauthorized data access attempts: >10 per hour
- Suspicious IP activity: >50 requests per minute

## Incident Response

### Response Protocol
1. **Detection**
   - Automated threat detection
   - 24/7 security monitoring
   - User-reported incidents

2. **Containment**
   - Immediate threat isolation
   - Affected system quarantine
   - Evidence preservation

3. **Eradication**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Threat removal
   - System hardening

4. **Recovery**
   - System restoration
   - Data verification
   - Service resumption

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Incident documentation
   - Policy updates
   - Team debriefing

## Security Measures

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 + JWT implementation
- 1-hour access token validity
- 30-day refresh tokens with rotation
- Biometric authentication for mobile devices
- MFA enforcement for all clinical staff

### Encryption
- AES-256-GCM for field-level encryption
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- 90-day key rotation policy
- Hardware Security Module integration

### Network Security
