EMR-Integrated Task Management Platform

1. WHY – Vision & Purpose

1.1 Purpose & Problem Statement
	•	Primary Problem:
Healthcare environments suffer from fragmented task management and communication gaps. Non-medical staff often struggle with manually interpreting EMR data into actionable tasks, leading to delayed or miscommunicated instructions and compliance risks. Additionally, daily shift handovers are prone to information loss, as key tasks and critical events are not summarized efficiently for the next team.
	•	Target Users:
	•	Non-Medical Staff: Nurses, aides, and administrators who need a clear, intuitive interface to view, execute, and verify clinical tasks.
	•	Doctors: Occasional task creators/validators who require rapid, EMR-verified data extraction for task generation.
	•	Administrators: Personnel overseeing compliance, system health, and overall workflow efficiency.
	•	Value Proposition:
A unified, EMR-integrated task management system that automatically verifies clinical data, generates tasks in a Trello-like Kanban board, and enables offline-first functionality. A standout feature is its “Shift Handover” module: a bulk, automated mechanism to transfer tasks between shifts, providing a concise summary of critical events and pending actions—improving continuity of care, reducing errors by up to 40%, and ensuring 100% data accuracy.

2. WHAT – Core Requirements

2.1 Functional Requirements

Core Features:
	•	EMR-Verified Task Creation:
	•	Data Integration: Auto-generate tasks by extracting and verifying EMR data using FHIR R4/HL7 v2 standards and vendor-specific adapters (e.g., Epic, Cerner).
	•	Normalization: Use a Universal Data Model (UDM) to standardize information across various systems.
	•	Trello-Style Kanban Board:
	•	Task Management: Provide a drag-and-drop interface with columns for “To-Do,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.”
	•	Priority & Due Dates: Enable priority tagging, deadline management, and dependency tracking.
	•	Offline-First Execution:
	•	Local Data Store: Implement SQLite/Hive for local task storage and background synchronization.
	•	Conflict Resolution: Use CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) combined with version vectors for seamless offline-to-online sync.
	•	Real-Time Alerts & Notifications:
	•	Push & SMS Alerts: Notify users about overdue tasks, EMR data mismatches, or doctor overrides in real time.
	•	Audit Trails & Compliance:
	•	Immutable Logs: Maintain detailed, tamper-proof audit logs of every task action, EMR validation, and user confirmation.
	•	Shift Handover Capability (New):
	•	Bulk Handover Module:
	•	Data Aggregation: At shift end, automatically aggregate tasks across multiple patients.
	•	Summary Generation: Generate a concise summary that highlights critical events (e.g., vital alerts, escalated tasks) and lists pending items for the incoming shift.
	•	Bulk Assignment: Enable supervisors to review, modify if necessary, and assign the bulk handover tasks to the next shift’s designated staff.
	•	Reporting & Verification: Provide visual reports (charts, lists) and export options (PDF/CSV) for shift handover summaries, ensuring continuity and accountability.

User Capabilities:
	•	Non-Medical Staff (Aides, Nurses):
	•	Task Execution: View, sort, filter, and complete tasks via barcode scanning (for medication verification), digital signature capture, and voice notes.
	•	Feedback Loop: Flag discrepancies and attach media (photos/voice recordings) to tasks for review.
	•	Doctors:
	•	Task Generation: Generate tasks directly from EMR notes with one-click actions, adjust dosages, or override tasks as needed—adding audit comments.
	•	Administrators:
	•	Oversight: Manage role-based access, monitor compliance dashboards, review audit logs, and configure EMR adapter settings.
	•	Shift Handover Management: Verify the shift handover reports, adjust bulk assignments, and escalate unresolved tasks if required.

4. User Experience

4.1 Primary User Flows

A. Task Creation & EMR Verification (Doctor Flow)
	1.	Entry:
	•	Doctor logs into the system via mobile or web.
	2.	Flow:
	•	Select a patient and view verified clinical data from the EMR.
	•	Use one-click actions to auto-generate tasks (e.g., “Administer 5 mg Drug X at 2 PM”).
	•	Adjust tasks manually if necessary (e.g., override dosage or time) with audit comments.
	•	Confirm creation and assign tasks to designated non-medical staff.
	3.	Outcome:
	•	Tasks appear on the Kanban board with attached EMR verification details.

B. Task Execution & Confirmation (Non-Medical Staff Flow)
	1.	Entry:
	•	Non-medical staff logs into the mobile app.
	2.	Flow:
	•	View tasks on a drag-and-drop Kanban board organized by status.
	•	Execute tasks by scanning barcodes (or using voice/digital signature) to verify EMR data.
	•	Confirm task completion; if offline, data is stored locally and synced later.
	3.	Outcome:
	•	Task status updates in real time, with audit logs capturing each confirmation and any flagged discrepancies.

C. Shift Handover (Bulk Task Handover Flow)
	1.	Entry:
	•	At the end of a shift, the system automatically aggregates all tasks and events across patients.
	2.	Flow:
	•	Bulk Aggregation:
	•	Collect tasks that remain pending, tasks recently completed, and any flagged incidents.
	•	Generate a summarized report highlighting:
	•	Critical Events: Vital alerts, emergency overrides, and escalated tasks.
	•	Pending Tasks: Tasks not completed within their deadlines or flagged for review.
	•	Supervisor Review:
	•	Supervisors log into the admin dashboard to review the bulk summary.
	•	Modify or reassign tasks as needed, then assign the complete handover package to the incoming shift.
	3.	Outcome:
	•	A clear, comprehensive shift handover report is available to ensure continuity of care and accountability. The incoming shift can quickly see the state of care for each patient.

D. Administrative & Compliance Oversight (Admin Flow)
	1.	Entry:
	•	Administrator logs into the web dashboard.
	2.	Flow:
	•	Monitor overall task progress, sync status, and review real-time dashboards.
	•	Access detailed audit trails and compliance reports (e.g., overdue tasks, EMR discrepancies).
	•	Configure system settings including EMR integration, user roles, and task escalation rules.
	3.	Outcome:
	•	Administrators gain full visibility and control over the workflow, ensuring operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

4.2 Core Interfaces
	•	Kanban Board:
	•	Visual, drag-and-drop task management with columns for “To-Do,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.”
	•	EMR Verification Panel:
	•	Side-by-side display of EMR data versus scanned inputs with discrepancy alerts.
	•	Shift Handover Dashboard:
	•	Bulk summary view with critical events and pending tasks, exportable to PDF/CSV.
	•	Admin Console:
	•	Detailed compliance dashboards, audit logs, and system configuration tools.

5. Business Requirements

5.1 Access Control & Authentication
	•	User Roles:
	•	Aide: Limited to task viewing and execution.
	•	Nurse: Can edit tasks and resolve discrepancies.
	•	Doctor: Authorized to create, adjust, and override tasks.
	•	Admin: Full system control including configuration, auditing, and shift handover oversight.
	•	Authentication:
	•	Multi-factor authentication using biometric + SSO (e.g., Okta, Auth0) with role-based access controls.
	•	Authorization:
	•	Fine-grained permission policies ensuring users only access functions relevant to their role.

5.2 Business Rules
	•	Data Validation:
	•	EMR-verified data must match task inputs (e.g., medication type, dosage, timing).
	•	Reject or flag tasks if discrepancies are detected (e.g., barcode mismatch, EMR update mid-task).
	•	Task Locking & Escalation:
	•	Auto-lock tasks if underlying EMR data changes after task initiation.
	•	Escalate unresolved or overdue tasks to supervisors if pending longer than a predefined threshold (e.g., 10–15 minutes).
	•	Audit & Compliance:
	•	Maintain immutable logs for every task action, shift handover, and override to ensure full compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and LGPD.
